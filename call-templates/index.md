# GSoC Cohort Calls

In order to give students a good sense of community, and to help them learn about the software they'll be working on, we run several full-group calls throughout GSoC. We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for this, primarily because it allows us to break up community calls into smaller breakout groups for discussions.

## Application period: GSoC webinar

During the application period, we usually run a recorded call for all interested attendees. This covers the following topics:  
- testimonials and application from students in previous years
- mentors discussing the goals of each project and answer any applicant questions

## Accepted student projects

Accepted students are invited to participate in the following calls:  

### Month one: **GSoC kick-off** 
  - Attending: students, as many mentors as possible
  - Tell the students about 
    - the org and general roadmap
    - working policies for the next few months
  - students introduce themselves and their project plans
  - group activity: students discuss good and bad things they've encountered in open source and/or software development. This aims to get students thinking about good practices for their own repos. 

### Month two: **Coding good practices, providing feedback, and code review** 
  - Attending: students, mentors optional but welcome
  - Group discussion: What makes code good? What makes it awful? 
  - Break-out room: students begin by reviewing code of _others_ (i.e. repos that don't belong to the org) in groups of 2-3.
  - Giving feedback: As a group we discuss the importance of giving both positive and negative feedback, and how to do so effectively and compassionately. 
  - Break-out room: In groups of 2-3, students bring one of their own repos that they've been working on, and provide each other with feedback. 

### Month three: **Practice for final presentations**  
  - Attending: Mentors aren't invited to this call, just to give students a safe space to practice with the team. 
  - Students are reminded of the feedback exerise we did last call
  - Students present for five minutes, practicing what they'll share with the whole InterMine community at the end of the month
    - Each other student provides one bit of positive feedback and one suggestion to improve for each talk. 
    
### Final Evaluation Period: **Final presentations**
  - Attending: All the InterMine community is invited. 
  - Students present their refined presentations, with a strict 5-minute time limit.
