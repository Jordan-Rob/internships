Welcome to the InterMine GSoC 2018 homepage!

## Students

We're excited that you're interested in GSoC with InterMine! Feel free to browse our [project ideas list](project-ideas/2018/) and please review the [InterMine application guidelines](guidance/students-applying/). If you're interested in a project, please email _both_ mentors listed for the project. We'll be happy to discuss the projects in more detail. 

For GSoC applications, your proposal is more important than making PRs or prototypes. However - if you'd like to start contributing to InterMine, you're welcome to do this anytime, not just GSoC! 

To get started:

- Take the [FlyMine](https://flymine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tutorial. InterMine has lots of mines (see the [registry](http://registry.intermine.org/)), FlyMine is an InterMine instance loaded with fruit fly data. This is how people access data using InterMine using the web browser.
- Take the [Python](https://github.com/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs/) or [Perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Webservice-InterMine/lib/Webservice/InterMine/Cookbook.pod) InterMine tutorials. InterMine has [client libraries](https://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/_ in Python, Perl, JavaScript and Java. This is how people access data using InterMine using the command line. 

Now you have a pretty good idea of how people use InterMine to search genomic data!

Check out these locations:

- Issues labelled [good first bug](https://github.com/intermine/intermine/labels/good%20first%20bug) in InterMine - some of these don't require any coding so can be easy to get started.
- [Help Wanted](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/labels/Help%20Wanted) in BlueGenes, our ClojureScript-based UI.

Finally, if none of those suit you we are happy to hear about your project ideas. Can you think of new features or improvements for InterMine? Maybe a new tutorial or data visualisation?

You can read more about how Google Summer of Code went last year with InterMine in [our blog](https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/tag/gsoc-2017/).
