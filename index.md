Welcome to the InterMine GSoC homepage! 

## Students

We're excited that you're interested in GSoC with InterMine!

The InterMine team is deeply passionate about open source and open science. Working with InterMine you'll be solving fun real world problems using new and exciting technologies.

### Pick a project

Browse our [project ideas list](project-ideas/2018/) and review the [InterMine application guidelines](guidance/students-applying/). If you're interested in a specific project, read the project description in detail and there should be a "Get started" section that will let you know what to do next. Please feel free to pop onto the #GSoC channel on our [chat server](http://chat.intermine.org) if you get stuck or have questions.

### Contribute to InterMine! (outside of GSoC)

For GSoC applications, your proposal is more important than making PRs or prototypes. However - if you'd like to start contributing to InterMine, you're welcome to do this anytime, not just GSoC! 

Check out these locations:

- Issues labelled [good first bug](https://github.com/intermine/intermine/labels/good%20first%20bug) in InterMine - some of these don't require any coding so can be easy to get started.
- [Help Wanted](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/labels/Help%20Wanted) in BlueGenes, our ClojureScript-based UI.
- The InterMine [Outreach repository](https://github.com/intermine/outreach/issues/), in particular the [ideas for newly interested InterMiners to try out](https://github.com/intermine/outreach/issues/12) ticket. 

You can read more about how Google Summer of Code went in previous years with InterMine in [our blog](https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/tag/gsoc/).
