Welcome to the InterMine GSoC homepage! 

## About us

[InterMine](http://intermine.org/) is an open source biological data warehouse, based in the University of Cambridge. There are nearly thirty instances of public InterMines, covering a range of subjects from organisms like mice and rats, mines dedicated to plants such as the soybean, insects like the fruitfly or bees and wasps, and even mines dedicated to mitochondrial DNA and discovering drug targets. You can see a full list in the [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/), which incidentally was a project carried out by a GSoC 2017 student!

We're interested in mentoring students with computer science, informatics (bioinformatics, cheminformatics, etc.) or computational biology experience and/or demonstrable interest.

You don't have to be a biologist to work on InterMine related projects - many of the full time developers on the team didn't come from a biology background.

We use a range of languages in our projects, but most commonly you'll see Java, Python, SQL, Clojure/ClojureScript, and JavaScript. Each instance of InterMine has its own set of web services, and there are client libraries in [six different languages](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/).

## Students

We're excited that you're interested in GSoC with InterMine!

The InterMine team is deeply passionate about open source and open science. Working with InterMine you'll be solving fun real world problems using new and exciting technologies.

### Pick a project

Browse our [project ideas list](project-ideas/2018/) and review the [InterMine application guidelines](guidance/students-applying/). If you're interested in a specific project, read the project description in detail and there should be a "Get started" section that will let you know what to do next. Please feel free to pop onto the #GSoC channel on our [chat server](http://chat.intermine.org) if you get stuck or have questions.

### Contribute to InterMine! (outside of GSoC)

For GSoC applications, your proposal is more important than making PRs or prototypes. However - if you'd like to start contributing to InterMine, you're welcome to do this anytime, not just GSoC! 

Check out these locations:

- Issues labelled [good first bug](https://github.com/intermine/intermine/labels/good%20first%20bug) in InterMine - some of these don't require any coding so can be easy to get started.
- [Help Wanted](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/labels/Help%20Wanted) in BlueGenes, our ClojureScript-based UI.
- The InterMine [Outreach repository](https://github.com/intermine/outreach/issues/), in particular the [ideas for newly interested InterMiners to try out](https://github.com/intermine/outreach/issues/12) ticket. 

You can read more about how Google Summer of Code went in previous years with InterMine in [our blog](https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/tag/gsoc/).


## Mentors

If you're an active InterMine user, developer, or maintainer, and you have an interesting idea you'd like to suggest and/or mentor, please either email `yo at intermine.org`, [make a pull request or issue on our GSoC repo](https://github.com/intermine/gsoc), or [contact us](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/contact-us/).
