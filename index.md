Welcome to the InterMine GSoC 2018 homepage!

## Students

We're excited that you're interested in GSoC with InterMine! Feel free to browse our [project ideas list](project-ideas/2018/) - we'll be happy to start discussing applications after the 12th of February if InterMine is accepted as a mentor organisation.  See the [GSoC Timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline) for more details.

If you'd like to start contributing to InterMine, you're welcome to do this anytime, not just GSoC! Check out these locations:

- Issues labelled [good first bug](https://github.com/intermine/intermine/labels/good%20first%20bug) in InterMine - some of these don't require any coding so can be easy to get started.
- [Help Wanted](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/labels/Help%20Wanted) in BlueGenes, our ClojureScript-based UI.

You can read more about Google Summer of Code 2017 with InterMine in [our blog](https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/tag/gsoc-2017/).


## Mentors

If you're an active InterMine user, developer, or maintainer, and you have an interesting idea you'd like to suggest and/or mentor, please either email `yo at intermine.org`, [make a pull request or issue on our GSoC repo](https://github.com/intermine/gsoc), or [contact us](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/contact-us/).
