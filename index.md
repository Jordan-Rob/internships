Welcome to the InterMine GSoC homepage! 

## Students

We're excited that you're interested in GSoC with InterMine!

### Get started

- Take the [FlyMine](https://flymine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tutorial or watch some helpful [videos](http://intermine.org/tutorials/). InterMine has lots of mines (see the [registry](http://registry.intermine.org/)), FlyMine is an InterMine instance loaded with fruit fly data. This is how people access data in an InterMine using the web browser.
- Take the [Python](https://github.com/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs/) or [Perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Webservice-InterMine/lib/Webservice/InterMine/Cookbook.pod) InterMine tutorials. InterMine has [client libraries](https://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/) in Python, Perl, JavaScript, R and Java. This is how people access data in an InterMine using the command line. 

Now you have a pretty good idea of how people use InterMine to search genomic data!

### Select a project

Browse our [project ideas list](project-ideas/2018/) and please review the [InterMine application guidelines](guidance/students-applying/).

Please feel free to pop onto our GSoC channel on our [chat server](http://chat.intermine.org) if you get stuck or have questions.
