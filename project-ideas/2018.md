## Cross-InterMine search tool
### Description:
There are lots of InterMines based in different locations around the world. It would be nice to use [InterMine WebServices](http://iodocs.apps.intermine.org/) to type a search term once, and search many (or all) InterMines at the same time, then display all results sets on the same page. Would use the InterMine registry ([ui](http://registry.intermine.org/), [api docs](http://registry.intermine.org/api-docs/), [api](http://registry.intermine.org/service/instances)) to pull an up-to-date list of InterMines.  
#### Project results:
A client-driven cross-InterMine search page.
#### Skills required:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, (or some language that compiles to JavaScript). No biological knowledge required.
#### Skill level:
Medium.
#### Mentors:
- Yo Yehudi - yo@intermine.org
- Nadia Yudina - joystate@me.com

## Data browser tool
### Description:
InterMine needs a faceted search tool to display data. E.g something like https://dcc.icgc.org/search. A possible (but non-binding) mockup of how this might look for InterMine is available here: https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/3cd706c4-2c71-49fa-b8e7-c724432c26e4/0
#### Project results:
A tool to browse InterMine data
Skills required: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, (or some language that compiles to JavaScript). No biological knowledge required.
#### Skill level:
Medium.

#### Mentors:
- Yo Yehudi - yo@intermine.org
- Nadia Yudina joystate@me.com

## Python client expansion
### Description:
InterMine has a client in Python with enables the querying of InterMine databases via Python scripts. However this client does not include all functionality available in InterMine so we’d like to extend the library to include features such as the region search and enrichment. See here for project details
#### Project results:
Improved InterMine Python client
#### Skills required:
Python, No biological knowledge required.
#### Skill level:
Medium.
#### Mentors:
- Julie Sullivan - julie@intermine.org
- Needs another possible mentor! (Please discuss with Julie if you're interested!)


## InterMineR package expansion

### Description:
InterMineR package provides an interface of the R programming environment with InterMine databases. The package facilitates the performance of complex queries and enrichment analysis with R, and has been accepted in Bioconductor. However, there are still many features that can be added to improve its functionality and usability. Therefore we’d like to create a Shiny-based UI, to facilitate the usage of InterMineR, and build-in functions for visualization and statistical analysis based on the ggplot2 and igraph R packages.
#### Project results:
Improved InterMineR package
#### Skills required:
- R programing language
#### Skill level:
#### Mentors:
