# Projects

## InterMine ElasticSearch/Solr deep bio data search
At the moment, we use an older version of Lucene to index the contents of a mine in a primitive way (i.e. we put almost every field into the index and do some simple weighting). This is stuffed into InterMine’s own PostgreSQL database and rehydrated at runtime. We want to use a modern search system so your mission (should you choose to accept it) would be to:

- Assess [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co) (ES) and [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) (especially [BioSolr](https://github.com/flaxsearch/BioSolr)) as to which would be better to include with InterMine. We (the mentors) will make a joint assessment with you as to which to use.
- Re-code and re-architect InterMine to use ES/Solr instead of embedded Lucene. This means managing a separate process whilst keeping the system simple for a non-developer to set up and use.
- Explore how ES/Solr can provide more sophisticated search for InterMine (e.g ontology enhanced search via BioSolr).

#### Project results:
InterMine uses a modern search system which improved searchability.

#### Skill level:
Hard

#### Skills required
- Java
- Docker or a strong interest to learn
- Solr/Elasticsearch or a strong interest to learn

#### Mentors
- Daniela Butano - daniela@intermine.org
- Justin Clark-Casey - justincc@intermine.org

## Buzzbang Google-like bio data search
Life sciences produce a vast amount of data with a very wide range, encompassing everything from gene and protein sequences to biobank samples and bioinformatics training courses. This data is also distributed amongst a multitude of websites, making it hard to search. A new initiative called [Bioschemas](http://bioschemas.org) provides a way to embed structured markup in webpages using [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org), which we can then crawl to provide a Google-like search over the biological web.  

### Tasks:
- Improve the mechanisms for embedding Bioschemas markup in InterMine webpages
- Help us improve the Buzzbang Bioschemas crawler and indexer
- Help us improve the Buzzbang search frontend.

#### Project results:
InterMine has a generic way to embed Bioschemas markup and improved mechanisms for crawling, indexing and searching such markup.

#### Skill level:
Hard

#### Skills required
- Java
- Python
- Solr
- Flask

## Automated test suite for ClojureScript application
BlueGenes ([GitHub](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes), [Demo](http://bluegenes.apps.intermine.org/)) is a [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) browser-based UI for [InterMine](http://intermine.org/) that is lacking in good tests. Currently, before merging a pull request, reviewers need to manually validate certain pages work correctly using a [checklist](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/blob/dev/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Ideally many of these checks could be automated into a test suite to save reviewers time and making it harder to miss errors! See our possible [testcase list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R6JZcHMoyXCFgP7Qm-UH4Jzr-rNqBPunBHxiTWrfs2I/edit#gid=0) (this list is still growing!). More info on the project available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x6cFwXHVVKrKblKpmh3PrPobWHJuD1qsPvEPhgg4si4/edit#)

#### Project results:
A headless (e.g. phantomjs or similar) UI test suite using a mock server for http requests. Stretch goal: hooked up to [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) or similar CI.

#### Skills required:
- Clojurescript / Clojure
- Advantageous: ability to examine software and identify+implement useful test cases.

#### Skill level:
Medium.

#### Mentors:
- Yo Yehudi yo@intermine.org
- Josh Heimbach josh@intermine.org

## Query builder structured language to natural language translator
InterMine uses a structured GUI-based query builder ([demo](http://www.flymine.org/flymine/customQuery.do)) to allow users to construct queries into complex biological data. Whilst InterMine experts are comfortable building queries with this interface, it's not entirely intuitive and can seem intimidating to newer users, despite [extensive help  documentation](http://flymine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/query-builder/Documentationquerybuilder.html). Given that all queries _can_ be expressed in natural language, we would like to build a library that can translate a natural language statement to an InterMine query. Please read [the full spec doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkUpDxFpd1sBCR5zM_5NBNdT7DsjgeksD-TofAt2S8g/edit?usp=sharing) before applying.

#### Project results:
Turn a natural language sentence into a InterMine [PathQuery](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pathquery/).

#### Skills required:
- ClojureScript / Clojure OR JavaScript

#### Skill level:
Medium.

- Yo Yehudi yo@intermine.org

## Cross-InterMine search tool
There are lots of InterMines based in different locations around the world. It would be nice to use [InterMine WebServices](http://iodocs.apps.intermine.org/) to type a search term once, and search many (or all) InterMines at the same time, then display all results sets on the same page. Would use the InterMine registry ([ui](http://registry.intermine.org/), [api docs](http://registry.intermine.org/api-docs/), [api](http://registry.intermine.org/service/instances)) to pull an up-to-date list of InterMines.  

#### Project results:
A client-driven cross-InterMine search page.

#### Skills required:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, (or some language that compiles to JavaScript). No biological knowledge required.

#### Skill level:
Medium.

#### Mentors:
- Yo Yehudi - yo@intermine.org
- Nadia Yudina - joystate@me.com

## Data browser tool
InterMine needs a faceted search tool to display data. E.g something like https://dcc.icgc.org/search. A possible (but non-binding) mockup of how this might look for InterMine is available here: [https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/3cd706c4-2c71-49fa-b8e7-c724432c26e4/0](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/3cd706c4-2c71-49fa-b8e7-c724432c26e4/0). Further info is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E8bJy8w4bQ16W7rokiMDj4Jpds2Zz1dhcDRYCiUZ_lA/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Project results:
A tool to browse InterMine data
Skills required: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, (or some language that compiles to JavaScript). No biological knowledge required.

#### Skill level:
Medium.

#### Mentors:
- Yo Yehudi - yo@intermine.org
- Nadia Yudina - joystate@me.com

## Python client expansion
InterMine has a client in Python with enables the querying of InterMine databases via Python scripts. However this client does not include all functionality available in InterMine so we’d like to extend the library to include features such as the region search and enrichment. [See here for project details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KI3f2ArHAbssVV1g6L7-Oxk7CatK2r7iH0inoUrbgfQ/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Project results:
Improved InterMine Python client

#### Skills required:
Python, No biological knowledge required.

#### Skill level:
Medium.
