# Guidance for Mentors

Please see the [Guidance for accepted students](students-accepted.md) for general student expectations. Mentors based onsite at Cambridge will provide weekly updates at the team meeting.

Also read (or at least skim!) the [Google Manual](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) for mentors. It's actually very useful.
