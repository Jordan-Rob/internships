# Application advice for students

## About us

[InterMine](http://intermine.org/) is an open source biological data warehouse, based in the University of Cambridge. There are nearly thirty instances of public InterMines, covering a range of subjects from organisms like mice and rats, mines dedicated to plants such as the soybean, insects like the fruitfly or bees and wasps, and even mines dedicated to mitochondrial DNA and discovering drug targets. You can see a full list in the [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/), which incidentally was a project carried out by a GSoC 2017 student!

We're interested in mentoring students with computer science, informatics (bioinformatics, cheminformatics, etc.) or computational biology experience and/or demonstrable interest.

You don't have to be a biologist to work on InterMine related projects - many of the full time developers on the team didn't come from a biology background.

We use a range of languages in our projects, but most commonly you'll see Java, Python, SQL, Clojure/ClojureScript, and JavaScript. Each instance of InterMine has its own set of web services, and there are client libraries in [six different languages](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/).

## Getting started

- Take the [FlyMine](https://flymine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tutorial or watch some helpful [videos](http://intermine.org/tutorials/). InterMine has lots of mines (see the [registry](http://registry.intermine.org/)), FlyMine is an InterMine instance loaded with fruit fly data. This is how people access data in an InterMine using the web browser.
- Take the [Python](https://github.com/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs/) or [Perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Webservice-InterMine/lib/Webservice/InterMine/Cookbook.pod) InterMine tutorials. InterMine has [client libraries](https://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/) in Python, Perl, JavaScript, R and Java. This is how people access data in an InterMine using the command line. 

Now you have a pretty good idea of how people use InterMine to search genomic data!

### Custom projects

We're open to project proposals that aren't on this list. If you think you might have an idea that utilises the InterMine APIs, data, or codebase in some way, [contact us](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/contact-us/) to discuss it.

### Proposal Guidelines

We expect to receive, as we did last year, lots of high quality applications. So please do give your application some thought!

* Follow the InterMine proposal template exactly!
* A clear understanding of the problem we need solved.
* A clear plan of action. What are you going to actually do?
* Milestones should be achievable and realistic.
* Things happen! We can’t foresee every problem! We are happy to see proposals that say “I will do A and B. If there is time, I will do C.”
* Read the proposal from one of our [successful 2018 applicants](https://github.com/nupurgunwant/GSoC-Proposal) to get an idea of what a good proposal might look like. 

We are happy to read your proposal and give you feedback. Please allow for a few days for us to get back to you -- don’t wait until the last minute!
